# Pyspark_Nuclear_Classification

This section outlines two different machine learning distributed models that classify the conditions of nuclear reactor. Linear regression model is presented first and following the Gradient boosted tree model. The models were developed in Colab environment with the advantage of PySpark ML library. Additionally, helper methods and libraries were utilised for implementing various operations in data pre-processing that are going to be mentioned in the following subsections.


## Execution Environment

### Google Colab

1. Upload the notebook file.
2. Upload the dataset.csv and make sure is called dataset.csv.
3. Run all cells.

### Jupyter

1. Start the Jupyter environment and open the notebook.
2. Install all the dependencies, such as Apache Spark, Spark Hive, Spark SQL, PySpark ML etc.
3. Make sure the dataset.csv is in the same folder with the notebook.
4. Run all cells.
